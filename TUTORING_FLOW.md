## Implementation Details

### Components
- `TutoringFormModal.tsx`: Main modal component for the tutoring booking flow
- `app/tutoring/page.tsx`: Route that redirects to the main page with tutoring modal
- Updated `BentoEnrollmentCard.tsx` and `BentoNetworkCard.tsx` to include tutoring buttons

### Navigation
- Direct access: `/tutoring` redirects to `/?modal=tutoring`
- Modal can be opened from multiple entry points:
  - "Book Tutoring" button on the main enrollment card
  - "Book Tutoring" button on the network card
  - "Book Tutoring" button in the CTA section

### UI Reuse
The tutoring flow reuses existing UI components:
- Progress bar/stepper from the coaching form
- Card components for provider and package selection
- Form components for checkout
- Modal structure and animations
- Button styles and interactions

### Animations
Following the workspace animation guidelines:
- Uses `ease-out-quart` for modal entrance/exit
- Fast animations (200-300ms duration)
- Hardware-accelerated transforms
- Reduced motion support

## Usage

## Technical Notes
